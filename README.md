# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure functionality and security is by continuously testing throughout the development process. By writing unit tests for every function, I can validate that their behavior is correct and expected. Testing edge cases and invalid inputs makes sure the program can handle unexpected behavior gracefully. For security, I validate and sanitize all user inputs, not trusting any external data, which helps avoid vulnverabilites. Handing my code off to someone else, so fresh eyes can review it is another strategy that I will definitely be employing to avoid the risk of overlooking issues in my design. Being proactive is the key to ensuring software is both functional and secure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interprety user needs, I focus on clear communication from the beginning of the project. I break down tasks that users must be able to accomplish into specfic and quanitfiable requirements that I can use to create my test cases. I frequently review the requirements throughout development to ensure the program stays aligned with client expectations.

# How do I approach designing software?
When desiging software, I start by thinking about the problem to be addressed and what the system needs to do. I break it down into its smaller components, each with a designated purpose. Then, I think about the flow of data through the system and the relationships between individual parts. A good software design is clear, logical, and focused on the needs of its users.
